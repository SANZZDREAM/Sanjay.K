“Create with logic, design with soul, and code with purpose.”

🔍 Who Am I?
Hi, I’m Sanjay, a passionate and purpose-driven tech learner from Tamil Nadu, India. Currently, I’m pursuing my B.E. in Electronics and Communication Engineering at RMD Engineering College (Batch 2024–2028). My mission is to bridge the gap between hardware and intelligent software, building systems that sense, decide, and evolve.

I thrive at the intersection of embedded systems, IoT development, and artificial intelligence. Whether it’s writing clean code for microcontrollers or training models for data prediction and automation, I believe in building solutions that make technology smarter and more human-friendly.

🌟 Vision: Sanzz Dream
In the next 10 years, I envision building Sanzz Dream—a next-generation AI + Robotics ecosystem. It will be a fusion of intelligent automation, edge computing, and creative user interaction, designed to contribute to the evolution of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and later, ASI (Artificial Superintelligence).
